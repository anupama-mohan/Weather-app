this Vue.js weather app allows users to search for weather information for multiple locations and displays it in a user-friendly manner using individual weather cards. Users can also delete locations from the list if needed.Overall, this component provides a structured and visually appealing way to display weather forecast information for a single day, including the day of the week, weather condition icon, and high/low temperatures. It's designed to be reusable and can be used within a larger weather forecast display, such as the one shown in the previous examples.

This Vue.js weather app consists of two main components: Searchinput.vue and WeatherCard.vue, along with the main application component.

Script Setup:

The script setup block is used to import necessary modules (ref from Vue) and components (Searchinput and WeatherCard).
It initializes a reactive variable places using ref([]), which will hold the weather data for multiple locations.
Two functions are defined:
addPlace(data): This function is called when a new location's weather data is received from the Searchinput component. It pushes the received data into the places array.
deletePlace(name): This function is called when a user decides to delete a location from the list. It prompts the user with a confirmation dialog and then removes the specified location from the places array.
Template:

The main template includes:
Date display: It shows the current date in a formatted way using JavaScript's toLocaleDateString method.
Search input component (Searchinput.vue): This component allows users to search for a location and adds it to the list of weather cards.
Weather cards: It iterates over the places array using v-for directive, rendering a WeatherCard component for each location. Each WeatherCard component receives the corresponding location's data as a prop and  listens for a delete event to remove the location from the list.
Weather Card Component (WeatherCard.vue):

This component displays weather information for a single location.
It receives the location's data as a prop (place).
It shows the location name, current weather conditions, temperature, and an option to delete the location from the list.
Search Input Component (Searchinput.vue):

This component allows users to search for a location by entering a query.
It sends the search query to an API and receives weather data for the corresponding location.
Once data is received, it emits a place-data event with the weather data to the parent component (App.vue) to add the location to the list.

This Vue.js component is responsible for displaying weather forecast data for a single day. Let's break down the code and understand its functionality:

Script Setup:

The defineProps function is used to declare the props that this component expects. In this case, it expects a prop named day, which is an object containing weather forecast data for a single day.
Template:

The template consists of a <div> element containing a table structure for displaying the weather forecast information for the given day.
Inside the table, there is a single row (<tr>) with three columns (<td>):
Day of the Week: This column displays the day of the week corresponding to the forecasted date. It uses JavaScript's Date object to convert the date string (day.date) into a human-readable format, specifically displaying the full name of the weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
Icon: This column displays an icon representing the weather condition for the day. It uses an <img> tag with the src attribute bound to day.day.condition.icon. This assumes that the day object contains nested objects (day and condition) representing the weather conditions, and icon is the URL of the icon for the condition.
High/Low Temperature: This column displays the maximum and minimum temperatures for the day. It uses Math.round to round the temperature values to the nearest whole number. The temperatures are obtained from day.day.maxtemp_c and day.day.mintemp_c, which represent the maximum and minimum temperatures in Celsius, respectively.

This Vue.js component is designed to display detailed weather information for a specific location. Let's go through its functionality:

Script Setup:

The defineProps function is used to declare the prop that this component expects. In this case, it expects a prop named place, which is an object containing weather data for the specific location.
Template:

The template consists of a <div> element with a class that styles it to appear as a modal or overlay at the bottom of the screen. It has a semi-transparent white background with a slight blur effect.
Close Button: This component includes a close button represented by an "x" icon. Clicking on this button triggers the $emit('close-info') event, which is caught by the parent component to close this detailed weather information overlay.
Weather Details: The weather details are displayed in two rows, each containing three columns:Wind Speed, Humidity Level, Precipitation: Each column displays a weather parameter icon (wind, droplet, umbrella) followed by the corresponding value for the current weather conditions at the specified location.
Wind Direction, Feels Like, UV Index: Similar to the previous row, each column displays an icon representing a weather parameter followed by its value.
Last Update and Delete Button: At the bottom, there is a section displaying the last update time of the weather data. Additionally, there is a button represented by a trash can icon, which, when clicked, triggers the $emit('remove-place') event. This event notifies the parent component to remove the current location from the list.
Overall, this component provides a visually appealing and informative display of detailed weather information for a specific location. It's designed to be reusable and can be used as an overlay or modal within a larger weather application interface.
